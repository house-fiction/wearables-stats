### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to prepare (tidy) data set based on the raw data from the Human Activity Recognition database (<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>)that meets the tidy data principles (Each variable you measure should be in one column, Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row).


### Contents

This repository contains the following files:

**run_analysis.R** - R-script to (re)create the (tidy) data set 

**TidyDataSet.txt** - a text file containing the output of the (tidy) data set generated from run_analysis.R

**CodeBook.md** - Code Book describing the variables of the (tidy) data set

### Steps to reproduce this project

1. Open the R script run_analysis.R using a text editor.
2. Change the file path of the working directory to your local folder/your working directory 
3. Run the R script run_analysis.R
